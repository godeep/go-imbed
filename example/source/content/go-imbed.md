`go-imbed` is a simple Go source generator to embed binary resources into Go executable.

## Why

`go-imbed` came up as a holiday side project for a very simple case of embedding a REST API documentation into the executable image. There are [plenty of tools](#other-tools) for embedding binary assets into executable  (which clearly shows demand for something what Go lacks at the moment), but hey, why not invent another wheel? Besides, stuffing binary asset into Go source file seemed too unaesthetic to me.
